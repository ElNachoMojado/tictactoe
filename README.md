# tictactoe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built in Ruby. This is the first project found in the Ruby module of the Full Stack Ruby on Rails course in The Odin Project.

<h2>Learnings</h2>
This was hard and exhausting. ChatGPT was the MVP during this project by helping me to understand errors I was commiting. I feel I have a better grasp for programming in Ruby and I feel more confident moving forward with the course. I learned how to better work with classes and make the code work in a more modular way, which is totally different to what I did with Javascript when doing the Foundations course in which my codes are more procedural. I got very frustrated at the end as I was getting many errors while trying to make my Board#update method to work the way I wanted it to. Turns out I just needed to get a better grasp of how objects work and maybe even work a bit more on the names of my variables. I was getting all mixed up because I was calling methods on the object themselves instead of the states/variables of the object (again, due to me not clearly understanding the concepts and due to bad decisions while naming variables).

I know my code might be sloppy, but I am proud of myself for managing to do this. I feel very accomplished as this is a project I been avoiding for almost a month due to my fear of classes.
